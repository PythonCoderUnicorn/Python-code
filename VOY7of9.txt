You will fail 






















Why assimilate a species that would detract from perfection?

Human attitudes toward death are perplexing
Too much importance is placed on it. There seem to be countless rituals and cultural beliefs designed to alleviate their fear of a simple biological truth. All organisms eventually perish.


 I don't understand the rules and procedures for this type of social occasion

We must get you to Sickbay 

Then you wish to copulate? Take off your clothes Don't be alarmed I won't hurt you

I have no need to ingest liquids  
I still receive energy from the Borg alcove
Borg do not consider giving technology away, only assimilating it

I understand the concept of humour It may not be apparent, but I am often amused by human behaviour
Your procedures are a waste of time
Crude but effective	 

What further answer do you require?

It will not happen again

You cannot understand what it is to be Borg

Your appeal to my humanity is pointless

Unacceptable, this alliance is terminated
adapt to service us


You lack harmony, cohesion, greatness
We understand 
Their assimilation would have greatly added to our own perfection


assimilate your vessel 
You are erratic, conflicted, disorganised

body was assimilated ceased to be human

lack the necessary range dispursive force
